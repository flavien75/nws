* NWS

** NWS is an online news reader

  I made this to replace the online news services that I've been
  using, as they became bloated and crippled with spyware. It's really
  a barebones system, but I've been using it for weeks now, and it
  basically does what I want.

*** Features
   - AJAX asynchronous loading of the feeds (ie reload one single feed w/o reloading the whole page)
   - Does its best to parse any given feed and identify it w/o questions.
   - Links directly on any included image Displays images full width if it's the only item's element
   - Plays nice with different resolutions, ie phones, tablets, etc
   - Lightweight and standard (valid HTML5 code)

*** Installation
   - Copy the files in a directory within a webserver root
   - Point a browser to the directory
   - Optional : Edit the .htaccess to protect restrict access to back-office
   - Use the "mgmt" link to access the "back office"
     - Use the "add a new feed" text entry field at the bottom to enter a new feed
     - Use the "new tab" text entry field to create a new category
     - Use the "change this feed's tab" menu to re-categorize the feed
     - Use the "promote this feed" (^) link to bump up a feed as 1st of its tab
     - Use the "delete this feed" (x) link to delete a feed

*** +TODO
  - A better sorting system. Right now it's quite a PITA when you add a new feed and assign it to a category/tab, to promote (^) the feeds and tabs to their previous locations
  - A sqlite DB (in a ramdisk where applicable). This plain text file is nice and portable and all, but it's damn slow
  - Some way of listening linked audio files & feeds
