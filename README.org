** NWS

* NWS is an online news reader

  I made this to replace the online news services that I've been
  using, as they became bloated and crippled with spyware. It's really
  a barebones system, but I've been using it for weeks now, and it
  basically does what I want.

* Features
  - Does its best to parse your feed and identify it w/o questions.
  - Links directly on any included image Displays images full width if it's the only item's element
  - Plays nice with different resolution, ie phones, tablets, etc.


* TODO
  - A better sorting system. Right now it's quite a PITA when you add
  - A new feed and assign it to a category/tab, to bump (^) the feeds
    and tabs to their previous locations. In fact I hate that.
  - A sqlite DB
