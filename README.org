** NWS

* NWS is an online news reader

  It's really a barebones system, I've been using it for a month and
  it basically does what I want.

* NWS est un aggr√©gateur de news

  C'est vraiment un CMS basique, mais je l'utilise tous les jours et
  il fait ce que je lui demande.

* Features
  - Does its best to parse your feed and identify it w/o questions.
  - Links directly on any included image Displays images full width if
  it's the only item's element
  - Plays nice with different resolution, ie phones, tablets, etc.


* TODO
  - A better sorting system. Right now it's quite a PITA when you add
  - A new feed and assign it to a category/tab, to bump (^) the feeds
    and tabs to their previous locations. In fact I hate that.
  - A sqlite DB
